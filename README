This is a emulator/assembler/disassembler for Notch's DCPU-16. Implemented in C

To build:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

To run: 
./dcpu ../mem1_text.hex

If ENABLE_TRACE is defined, it will print out the instructions it is executing.
In any case, it will print out a small section of the memory before and after
execution, as well as register values

The assembler is written in python 3 and requires ply which can be found at:
http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html

it can be run like:
./asm.py program.asm

and will produce a program.hex file in the same directory which can then be run
by dcpu

There is also a disassembler, which can be run via:
./disasm.py ./mem1_text.hex
