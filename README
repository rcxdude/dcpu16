This is a emulator for Notch's DCPU-16. Implemented in C

to build:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

to run: 
./dcpu ../mem1_text.hex

if ENABLE_TRACE is defined, it will print out the instructions it is executing.
In any case, it will print out a small section of the memory before and after
execution, as well as register values

there is also a disassembler written in python3, which can be run via:
./disasm.py ./mem1_text.hex
